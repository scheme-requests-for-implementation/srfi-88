<H1>Abstract</H1>

<P>
This SRFI defines <I>keyword</I> objects, a data type similar to
Scheme symbols.  Keyword objects have the same lexical syntax as
symbols but they must end in a colon.  Moreover keyword objects
are self-evaluating.
Procedures for converting between strings and keyword objects
(<TT>string-&gt;keyword</TT> and <TT>keyword-&gt;string</TT>)
and a type predicate (<TT>keyword?</TT>) are defined.  Finally
this SRFI specifies the changes to the Scheme lexical syntax required
to accomodate keywords.
</P>

<H1>Rationale</H1>

<P>
The motivation for keyword objects stems from the need for markers to
identify optional named parameters, such as in
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-89/">SRFI 89 (Optional positional
and named parameters)</a>.  Here we mean ``parameter'' in the general sense
of an API parameter (whether it is a syntactic or procedural API).
Nevertheless we will use the terminology of procedures, namely the
caller and callee, to identify the two sides of the API.
</P>

<P>
Optional named parameters are useful for APIs with many parameters,
most of which have a reasonable default value.  Using optional
positional parameters in this case is not appropriate because it is hard
to remember the position of a particular parameter P and it forces the
caller to supply the values of parameters that come before P, whether
it is the default value or not.  Here are a few APIs where optional
named parameters are particularly useful:

<LI> Constructors for documents with attributes, such as HTML code:

<PRE>
    (html-p align: 'center
            (html-font face: "helvetica"
                       size: "+3"
                       "Title"))
</PRE>

<LI> Hash-table constructor with many parameters (such as the minimum
     and maximum load factors, the initial size of the table, the key
     hash function and the key equality testing function to use, etc):

<PRE>
    (make-table size: 100000
                test: string=?
                hash: string-length)
</PRE>

<LI> Widget constructors for GUIs:

<PRE>
    (tcltk-frame relief: 'ridge
                 borderwidth: 4
                 height: "50px"
                 width: "100px")
</PRE>

<LI> A syntactic form for defining new record types and the
     generated record constructors:

<PRE>
    (define-type point
      id: _5c17ca1a-83e0-45eb-9c8e-74a03dfe89db
      x  ; x, y, z are fields required by the constructor
      y
      z)

    (define-type colored-point
      inherits: point
      id: _9d4ba977-2177-4650-8b96-2d781bfee771
      sealed: #t
      (color mutable: #f default: "black") ; color field is optional
      (layer default: 0 type: int8))       ; layer field is optional

    (define p1 (colored-point 1 2 3))
    (define p2 (colored-point 0 0 0 layer: 5))
</PRE>

<LI> Port opening procedures that support several port options:

<PRE>
    (open-file (list path: "myfile"
                     direction: 'output
                     char-encoding: 'UTF-8
                     eol-encoding: 'cr-lf
                     append: #t))
</PRE>

</OL>

<P>
The specification of the syntax for expressing optional named
parameter (such as an extension to the parameter list syntax) is left
for another SRFI, such as <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-89/">SRFI
89 (Optional positional and named parameters)</a>.  This SRFI
only specifies the keyword objects as a datatype.
</P>

<P>
Several implementations of Scheme currently feature keyword objects,
often modeled after the keyword objects specified in the DSSSL
standard or Common Lisp.  Here is a partial list: Bigloo, Chicken,
EdScheme, Gambit, Gauche, Guile, Jade (an implementation of DSSSL),
Kawa, MzScheme, STKlos, and Sizzle.
</P>

<P>
Unfortunately few of these implementations are compatible.  As far as
lexical syntax is concerned, in some implementations the colon must
come at the end (like in DSSSL), in some implementations it must come
at the beginning (as in Common Lisp) possibly prefixed with a hash
sign, and in other cases either at the beginning or end.  This SRFI
uses the trailing colon syntax because it does not conflict with
existing Scheme code which use identifiers with leading colon,
such as <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-42/">SRFI 42
(Eager Comprehensions)</a>.  The main purpose of this SRFI is to help
standardize keyword objects in these implementations and future
implementations that support them.
</P>

<H1>Specification</H1>

<P>
Like symbols, keywords are objects whose usefulness rests on the fact
that two keywords are identical (in the sense of <SAMP>eqv?</SAMP>)
if and only if their names are spelled the same way.  However,
keywords and symbols are distinct datatypes.  No keyword is identical
to a symbol (in the sense of <SAMP>eqv?</SAMP>) or any object of
another datatype.
</P>

<P>
At the lexical syntax level, keywords look like symbols that end with
a colon.  The R5RS lexical syntax category for symbols is
<TT>&#60;identifier&#62;</TT>.  This category must be changed so that
an identifier cannot end with a colon unless the symbol is <SAMP>:</SAMP> (a
symbol consisting of only a colon).  The categories
<TT>&#60;token&#62;</TT> and <TT>&#60;simple datum&#62;</TT> need to
be extended and the category <TT>&#60;keyword object&#62;</TT> needs
to be added as follows:
</P>

<PRE>
&#60;token&#62; --&#62; &#60;identifier&#62; | &#60;boolean&#62; | &#60;number&#62;
     | &#60;character&#62; | &#60;string&#62;
     | ( | ) | #( | <TT>'</TT> | <TT>`</TT> | , | ,@ | <B>.</B> | &#60;keyword object&#62;

&#60;simple datum&#62; --&#62; &#60;boolean&#62; | &#60;number&#62;
     | &#60;character&#62; | &#60;string&#62; |  &#60;symbol&#62; | &#60;keyword object&#62;

&#60;keyword object&#62; --&#62; &#60;identifier&#62; :
</PRE>

<P>
Note that the rule for <TT>&#60;keyword object&#62;</TT> must be valid
even in Scheme implementations that have extended the
<TT>&#60;identifier&#62;</TT> syntax to support quoted symbols as
specified in the original specification of
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-75/">SRFI 75 (R6RS Unicode data)</a>.
In other words, in such
implementations, <SAMP>|foo|:</SAMP> and <SAMP>foo:</SAMP> are the
same keyword, and <SAMP>|foo:|</SAMP> is a symbol, not a keyword,
and <SAMP>||:</SAMP> is a keyword.  Using this quoted keyword
lexical syntax all keyword objects produced by the
<SAMP>string-&gt;keyword</SAMP> procedure and written with the
<SAMP>write</SAMP> procedure will be read back in with the
<SAMP>read</SAMP> procedure as the identical keyword (in the sense
of <SAMP>eqv?</SAMP>).
</P>

<P>
Keywords are self evaluating.  The syntax of expressions must be
extended by modifying the category <TT>&#60;self-evaluating&#62;</TT>
to include <TT>&#60;keyword object&#62;</TT>:
</P>

<PRE>
&#60;self-evaluating&#62; --&#62; &#60;boolean&#62; | &#60;number&#62;
     | &#60;character&#62; | &#60;string&#62; | &#60;keyword object&#62;
</PRE>

<DL>
<DT><U>procedure:</U> <B>(keyword?</B> <I>obj</I><B>)</B>
<DD>
<P>
Returns <TT>#t</TT> if <VAR>obj</VAR> is a keyword object, otherwise returns <TT>#f</TT>.
</P>

<PRE>
(keyword? 'foo:)                    ==&#62;  #t
(keyword? foo:)                     ==&#62;  #t
(keyword? 'foo)                     ==&#62;  #f
(keyword? ':)                       ==&#62;  #f
(keyword? ||:)                      ==&#62;  #t  (if keyword quoting supported)
(keyword? (car '(a: b:)))           ==&#62;  #t
(keyword? "bar")                    ==&#62;  #f
</PRE>

</DL>

<DL>
<DT><U>procedure:</U> <B>(keyword-&#62;string</B> <I>keyword</I><B>)</B>
<DD>

<P>
Returns the name of <VAR>keyword</VAR> as a string.  It is an error
to apply mutation procedures like <CODE>string-set!</CODE> to strings returned
by this procedure.
</P>

<PRE>
(keyword-&#62;string foo:)              ==&#62;  "foo"
(keyword-&#62;string ||:)               ==&#62;  ""  (if keyword quoting supported)
(keyword-&#62;string
   (string-&#62;keyword "a b c"))       ==&#62;  "a b c"
</PRE>

</DL>

<DL>
<DT><U>procedure:</U> <B>(string-&#62;keyword</B> <I>string</I><B>)</B>
<DD>

<P>
Returns the keyword object whose name is <VAR>string</VAR>.
</P>

<PRE>
(string-&#62;keyword "foo")             ==&#62;  foo:
(string-&#62;keyword "")                ==&#62;  ||:  (if keyword quoting supported)
</PRE>

</DL>

<H1>Implementation</H1>

<P>
The implementation of keyword objects requires changing the reader and
the evaluator.  Although the changes are expected to be
straightforward they are obviously highly system dependent.  Here we
offer a simplistic `user-level' implementation (a.k.a. kludge) that
will work in Scheme implementations that allow colons anywhere in the
symbol.  The following implementation redefines the symbol related
primitives so that symbols ending with a colon are considered to be
keywords, not symbols.
</P>

<PRE>
    (define real-symbol? symbol?)
    (define real-symbol->string symbol->string)
    (define real-string->symbol string->symbol)

    (define looks-like-an-unquoted-keyword?
      (lambda (s)
        (let ((n (string-length s)))
          (and (> n 1)
               (char=? (string-ref s (- n 1)) #\:)))))

    (set! symbol?
      (lambda (obj)
        (and (real-symbol? obj)
             (not (looks-like-an-unquoted-keyword?
                   (real-symbol->string obj))))))

    (define keyword?
      (lambda (obj)
        (and (real-symbol? obj)
             (looks-like-an-unquoted-keyword?
              (real-symbol->string obj)))))

    (set! symbol->string real-symbol->string)

    (define keyword->string
      (lambda (k)
        (let* ((s (real-symbol->string k))
               (n (string-length s)))
          (substring s 0 (- n 1))))) ; remove the colon

    (set! string->symbol
      (lambda (s)
        (if (looks-like-an-unquoted-keyword? s)
            (error "sorry... the symbol would look like a keyword!")
            (real-string->symbol s))))

    (define string->keyword
      (lambda (s)
        (let ((s-colon (string-append s ":")))
          (if (looks-like-an-unquoted-keyword? s-colon)
              (real-string->symbol s-colon)
              (error "sorry... the keyword would look like a symbol!")))))
</PRE>

<P>
Note that this code does not implement the self-evaluation property of
keyword objects.  If the set of keyword objects used by a program is
known in advance, self-evaluation can be simulated with a set of
top-level definitions such as:
</P>

<PRE>
    (define foo: 'foo:)
    (define bar: 'bar:)
</PRE>

<P>
Although the implementation presented here is not generally
applicable, it may be useful to bootstrap a complete implementation of
keyword objects in a compiler.
</P>
